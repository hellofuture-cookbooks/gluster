gluster Cookbook
================

Originally from: https://github.com/biola/chef-cookbooks forked into it's own repo for use with Berkshelf.

This cookbook is used to install and configure Gluster on both servers and clients. This cookbook makes several assumptions when configuring Gluster servers:

1. Each disk will contain a single partition dedicated for Gluster
2. If the cookbook will be used to manage disks, each partition will be formatted with the ext4 filesystem rather than the recommended xfs filesystem to allow partitions to be resized (xfs filesystems cannot be resized on Ubuntu 12.04 systems without a newer kernel installed)
3. Non-replicated volume types are not supported
4. All peers for a volume will be configured with the same number of bricks

Requirements
------------
This cookbook requires Ubuntu version 12.04 or higher. All testing has been performed on Ubuntu 12.04.

Usage
-----

On two or more identical systems, attach the desired number of dedicated disks to use for Gluster storage. Create a role containing the gluster::server recipe for the gluster peers to use and add the appropriate attributes, such as volumes to the `['gluster']['server']['volumes']` attribute. If the cookbook will be used to manage disks, add the disks to the `['gluster']['server']['disks']` attribute; otherwise format the disks appropriately and add them to the `['gluster']['server']['volumes'][VOLUME_NAME]['disks']` attribute. Once all peers for a volume have configured their bricks, the 'master' peer (the first in the array) will create and start the volume.

For clients, create a role containing the gluster::default or gluster::client recipe, and add any volumes to mount to the `['gluster']['client']['volumes']` attribute. The Gluster volume will be mounted on the next chef-client run (provided the volume exists and is available) and added to /etc/fstab.
